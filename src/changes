Changes in FrogComposband 7.0.peppermint:

* Totally revamped the no-wilderness town, and fixed quest descriptions so
they're accurate with both wilderness and no wilderness

* Introduced a V-like system for tracking and describing object origins
(e.g. "Dropped by the Variant Maintainer on level 19 of Orc Cave."). This
system can be turned off (or expanded further) in the text display options

* Added back the no_selling birth option. In no_selling mode, selling items
is disabled but gold drops are increased to compensate. The intention is
that selling players and non-selling players will accumulate gold at roughly
the same pace, but since this was calibrated based on my own games, it
may not hold for players with different playstyles. No_selling mode does
not have any effect on gold drops in the wilderness

* Added a new option (easy_mimics) for players who really hate mimics,
cloakers, death swords, wall monsters etc. and want to reglyph them.
Turning on easy_mimics makes these monsters use the 'x' glyph instead of
their normal glyph (the monsters will retain their normal color, unless
that's pitch black, in which case it's changed to a slightly less black
black). It also makes monsters with the ATTR_CLEAR flag possible to see.
(Note that easy_mimics does not affect tree monsters or weird fumes, which
can be recognized through their color, nor does it affect creeping coins or
death scythes)

* Made easy_id stronger (it now *identifies* all items on walkover)

* It is now possible to request a new quest immediately after receiving the
reward for the old one, without the need to exit and re-enter the building

* Added a never_forget birth option for the ellipos types, which essentially
protects the player from amnesia and also gives ellipos's easy labyrinth

* Added two new birth options (no_chris and no_scrambling) that prevent
dungeon teleports and stat scrambling, respectively. (Both cause different
bad things to happen instead; they are not intended as easy-mode, but as
options for players who find chrissing and/or stat scrambling unfun and
think the game would be better if those effects didn't exist.)

* Added new monsters and tweaked existing ones

* Adapted some changes to artifacts that Gwarl made for ComPosband 7.0.4

* Added a new quest in Zul that enables teleporting between Zul and other
towns if successfully completed
[A fair warning about this quest. It's not *that* hard if you have great
stealth, but if you have poor stealth - or worse, aggravation - things can
get... entertaining. This is true of most quests of course, but particularly
true here. Doing it with both aggravation and low speed is not recommended,
and Sexy characters should treat it as an endgame quest and approach it with
extreme caution.]

* Rings and Death Swords are no longer limited to 1x free action or see
invisible

* Fixed a bug in Thalos that made the library inaccessible in late game

* Fixed a bug with lawyer *identify* (it cost zero mana and allowed the
player to also do normal identify on a different item)

* Fixed a bug that caused items in the home display to be sometimes shown
with a value of zero

* Fixed an old bug that caused some timed effects to be decreased on game
load, allowing the player to cure fear by saving and loading repeatedly.
(Something similar may still happen with other things, the code needs
closer scrutiny)

* Fixed an old PosChengband bug that allowed hidden information about
immunities to leak to the player through the character sheet

* Fixed an old PosChengband bug that sometimes caused the game to crash on
mangy leper attacks due to division by zero (thanks to Hugo for spotting
and reporting it)

* Fixed an ancient bug that made quests uncompletable if one of the target
monsters evolved or got polymorphed (this should now be impossible), and
tweaked monster evolution code (all of which is now in time_lord.c, instead
of being needlessly duplicated)

* Fixed a problem with using the '-' key to select a floor item in the
inscription menu

* Fixed an old bug that caused the game to crash with quest_unique off if
too many target monsters were killed in a random Angband quest

* Fixed an old bug that allowed skeletons to double their food pile by
eating from it

* Fixed an old bug that caused the wilderness to not generate properly
(potentially causing crashes) if the player saved and loaded the game
inside the arena

* Fixed a minor bug with using an unidentified device of detect traps,
which didn't mark grids as trap-detected even in cases where the effect's
obviousness meant there was no need to avoid spoiling (thanks to nikheizen
for reporting this)

* Plugged a number of old loopholes that allowed doppelgangers to retain
their demigod powers in forms other than Human and Demigod (thanks to murphy
for reporting this)

* Plugged an old information leak when uppercase keys were used in the
object prompt (thanks to murphy for reporting this as well)

* Objects thrown at a wall now land on the last square before the wall,
rather than attempting to land on the wall itself and ending up placed on
a random square adjacent to it (potentially creating the impression of an
object flying through a wall - thanks to bostock for reminding me of this)

* Destroying high-level law books now gives XP where appropriate (thanks
to bostock for this too)

* Slightly lowered the max power of ultra-strong deep dungeon randarts

* Slightly changed how the reforge cap is calculated to compensate for it
now being easier to acquire fame (due to the increased number of quests).
The cap now increases slightly slower in the fame range 128 to 223 (early
late game), with no effect on either midgame reforging or very-late-game
reforging. Essentially, the idea behind this change is to keep midgame
reforging viable and keep late game reforging strong, but still make it
somewhat harder to reach the late game reforge power

* Removed rogues' class life rating bonus

* Mine and Heaven now have bottom guardians

* Made the black aura worse

* Amulets of anti-summoning can no longer be generated on a shuffle

* Snotlings and doppelgangers can no longer shuffle for mushrooms

* Added a new deep cloak ego

* Added new artifacts

* Added more race-specific rewards for unusual races

* Made the Death realm's Vampirism True spell considerably more expensive

* Nerfed the Law realm's Expert Trap spell

* Made lawyer melee slightly weaker

* Improved savefile compatibility when new uniques are added

* Reduced the number of non-town monsters, and especially monster groups,
that appear in areas near towns

* Some early random Angband quests have a 20% chance to generate a bonus
reward (to compensate for an earlier change by Chris in PosChengband that
affected these quests negatively)

* Made melee attacks slightly more likely to break a glyph of warding

* The Hideout entrance, while still in Outpost, has been moved south; and
the player now starts the game on the Warrens entrance, not the Hideout one.
[Copied from ComPosband 7.1.0a]

* Imported new random artifact names from ComPosband 7.1.0a

* Potions of cure critical wounds no longer cure poison
[they were never intended to in ComPosband, and it was weird that they did
when potions of healing did not]

* Tweaked the walls of Crystal Castle
[Copied from ComPosband 7.0.4]

* Introduced a new flag that gives confused monsters a chance to shake
their confusion off super-fast before they move. (Currently, no monster
actually has this flag, apart from Utgard-Loke)

* Monsters should no longer generate on top of enclosed 1x1 dark pits

* Made the Temple more likely to stock potions of cure serious wounds
during the early game

* Corrected a minor issue with fear message grammar after a throw attack

* Improved the oook data in HTML character dumps (it now gives max exp
rather than cur exp, and also gives the player's true race rather than
a race they were temporarily polymorphed into or mimicking)

* Moved the Volcano, Dragon Slayer and Demon Slayer quests much deeper

* Updated the in-game FAQ

-------------------------------------------------------

Changes in FrogComposband 7.0.strawberry (compared to ComPosband 7.0.3):

* Rebalanced artifact reforging. The goal was to prevent silly-powerful items
while still allowing very strong items (so a character can reasonably expect
to use reforged items in the endgame and final fights). The importance of
fame in reforging was reduced slightly to make early/mid-game reforging more
appealing, though realistically reforging will likely remain mostly a
late-game thing. Slot weights were also adjusted slightly, with effects on
both reforging and randart creation. The hard cap of 90000 on the source
artifact's power was removed, although stronger artifacts will still be
treated as if they had a power of 90000, or even less for less weighty slots.
This prevents situations in which a very strong item is effectively worse
than a weaker item because it doesn't fit the player's needs directly and
cannot ever be reforged. Reforging is now also slightly cheaper

* Rebalanced shop shuffling. The cheap shuffling introduced in ComPosband
allowed characters to acquire silly piles of extremely powerful consumables
very easily, as long as they found a dungeon shop and had enough money. The
cheap shuffling has been retained, but many of the most powerful items
(like !Healing, !*Healing*, !Life, stat potions, ?Genocide, ?MassGenocide and
!NewLife) can no longer be generated on a shuffle. Also, Black Market
shuffling is more expensive now

* Moved Thalos, and added a new town (Anambar) where Thalos used to be.
Prettied up the Thalos map (and edited t_pref to include additional
terrain types). Mt. Olympus is now slightly more accessible since Thalos
is closer to it than any town was before (originally, I moved Thalos even
closer to Mt. Olympus, but then I decided I didn't hate you players enough).
There's an option to allow teleporting to Thalos as soon as any two other
towns (including Outpost) have been visited (because I decided I didn't want
you players to hate me either...!)

* Fixed an old PosChengband bug where quest seeds were lost on save/load,
meaning players who exited the game after requesting a quest would receive
a seed of 0 for that quest and consequently always get the first item from
a list of supposedly random rewards

* Fixed another old PosChengband bug whereby uniques seen through fuzzy
telepathy would sometimes acquire a stray "the" in front of their name
(e.g. "The Gertrude dies.")

* Fixed an old bug with file handling on Windows

* Fixed several minor old bugs related to weapon slays (chaos weapons were
getting massive extra damage against good monsters from the KILL_EVIL flag
instead of the KILL_GOOD flag; the displayed damage for a KILL_HUMAN
missile didn't match the actual damage; in the character sheet, the *Human*
slay's statistics were displayed for weapons with KILL_LIVING rather than
weapons with KILL_HUMAN)

* Updated the rumor list and silly name list

* Added a new realm (Law) and two new classes (Lawyer and Ninja-Lawyer)

* Added new monsters (and restored the deleted Egyptian gods)

* Added a few artifacts (and brought back the GHB's T-shirt)

* Added new random artifact names

* Added new quests (I actually feel like there may be too many early-game
quests now; feedback on the number of quests, and quests [whether new or old]
that players like or don't like, would be particularly welcome; of course,
there is no need to attempt to do every quest in the game at depth)

* In ComPosband, if a quest level was buggy and didn't generate properly, the
game would crash and the player would be forced to fail it on resuming play.
In FrogComposband, while the game will still crash, the player can continue
normally on resumption and can retake the quest after it has been fixed.
This should make life easier for both developers and test-players

* Gave eldraks a significant buff, they are now stronger than ettins
(consequently, swapped ettin and eldrak in the troll evolution sequence;
however, player trolls still evolve into ettins rather than eldraks)

* A small number of monsters can now initiate melee attacks from 2 squares
away. (Fair's fair - player samurai, dragons and archaeologists with whips
can do this!) Currently the only monsters with this ability are large
dinosaurs, novice archaeologists, balrogs, samurai, Godzilla and Jormungand.
(Jormungand, who was a soft guardian for its depth, also received a number
of other buffs; most notably, it now has the CAN_SWIM flag instead of the
AQUATIC flag.)

* Made ninjas slightly less outrageous by nerfing Bunshin (which now gives
a 1-in-3 chance of evading attacks, not 1-in-2) and Swap Position (which
now requires perfectly clear line of sight) and changing their weight limit
equation. The Swap Position nerf also affects the relevant mutation and
wild talent (the weight limit change does not affect other classes with a
weight limit, apart from ninja-lawyers)

* Restored the option of playing without virtues

* Fixed some typos here and there. (I know this will offend some people! But
they can take solace in that there are still plenty left.)

* Buffed Lucifer and made him dungeon boss of Hell

* The name of Sultan the Midget was reverted back to Snafu the Midget
(because of the one-Sultan rule - there's a sultan in Thalos)

* Players are now less likely to be ambushed by dangerous high-level sea
monsters in coastal towns

* Added some alternatives for non-English keyboards to support play on
angband.live: Y and Z for [ and {, Ctrl+Y for Ctrl+W, Ctrl+E for @ and
Ctrl+O for ]

* Made free action stronger because Chris's system was somewhat confusing
and unpopular, though the change here is not as big as what Gwarl did in
ComPosband 7.0.4. 1 source of free action works the same in FrogComposband
as in ComPosband 7.0.3 (and the last versions of PosChengband). 2 sources
are slightly stronger in FrogComposband (and give total paralysis immunity
against low-level monsters), and 3 sources give total immunity against all
monsters, except in special cases like ty_curse

* Changed how cur SP is calculated after a change to max SP

* Restored the old non-fuzzy telepathy as an option. Chris's fuzzy telepathy
is still the default

* Added an option (off by default) to force a -more- prompt on device/spell
fails

* Attempts to charm a monster with the hidden NOPET flag now give the message
"X is immune", rather than "X resists"; the NOPET flag is unpopular enough
without it making players guess whether the monster has it or not. (It's
also now slightly harder for monsters to acquire the NOPET flag.)

* Commented out the Windows pref file (font-win.prf). Windows users will
notice this as a change to the default appearance of walls and mountains

* Various minor tweaks and code improvements

Changes copied or adapted from ComPosband 7.0.4:

* Added Gwarl's new quests and adopted some of his changes to existing
quests

* The entrance to Hideout is now in Outpost, and the entrance to Icky Cave
is now in Thalos

* Adapted the new acid floor

* Magic shop now sells offensive wands

* Moved Tidal Cave

* Battlefield's entrance guardian is now a black wraith instead of a grave
wight

* Visual change to the appearance of Crystal Castle's glass floor

* Added Gwarl's buff to non-specialist riding

* Tweaked the depth and rarity of a number of items, especially dragon
scale mails (but not quite to the same extent as in ComPosband 7.0.4)

* Tweaked a number of monsters

-------------------------------------------------------

To do:

* Bring back the Lazy personality

* Look into adding new classes and/or personalities

* Look into adapting the bank from Frogspawn

* Look into importing content from poschengband-R (requested so far:
coffeebreak mode and the Alchemist class)
